Honestly, I thought that the content overall was pretty simple once I got used to it.

The specific words needed for certain elements to work certain ways was the part that kinda got me stumped at times
trying to figure out exactly what the exercise was asking for. But once I looked at a hint or just took a peek at
the answer, it was obvious and now I probably won't forget it. When I got to Overflow Exercise 2, I had my AHAA moment.
The reason being, the exercise specifically asked for "Specify that the overflowing text in the <div> element should
not be visible, not even with scrolling." So obviously the first thing I thought was "hmmm, that probably means that
the text should be HIDDEN at the overflow point." I literally put hidden for the overflow property and my heart got
kinda warm inside because I legitmately thought I was a coding genius for a second haha. But yeah, overall the content
was pretty straightforward and simple, it was just little things here and there that I kind of forgot but got back into
my mind once I realized that the answer was probably way more simple than what I thought it was. 

I think I could use the scroll bar (overflow) as well as the image element behind the heading text for my website for
the final project/website. The reason being, I might need to use the scroll bar to list out the tour dates that I have
in mind once I release my EP towards the end of the year. Also, the image element behind the heading text could be used
probably for the homepage since I probably just want one image on top of the page and some accompanying heading text
on top of the image as well as just below it.
